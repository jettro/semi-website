# Dataset News Publications

{% include badges.html %}

This dataset contains +/- 1000 random news articles from; Financial Times, New York Times, Guardian, Wallstreet Journal, CNN, Fox News, The Economist, New Yorker, Wired, Vogue, Game Informer.

This dataset can be used to easily demo all Weaviate's features.

- [Run with Docker Compose](#run-with-docker-compose)
- [Run manually](#run-manually)
- [More resources](#more-resources)

### Run with Docker Compose

If you want to run this dataset locally, you can run it in one go with Docker Compose.

The Docker Compose files below contain both Weaviate and the dataset.

```bash
# download the config file
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/semi-technologies/DEMO-datasets/master/newspublications/config.yaml
# download the Docker Compose file
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/semi-technologies/DEMO-datasets/master/newspublications/docker-compose.yml
# Run docker
$ docker-compose up
```

Weaviate will be available and preloaded with the newsarticle demo dataset on:

- `http://localhost:8080/`
- [Via the Playground](http://playground.semi.technology/?weaviateUri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2Fv1%2Fgraphql)

### Run manually

If you have your own version of Weaviate running on an **external** host or localhost **without** Docker Compose;

```bash
# WEAVIATE HOST (e.g., https://foobar.semi.network), note paragraph basics for setting the local IP
$ export WEAVIATE_HOST=WEAVIATE HOST
# Make sure to replace YOUR_HOST with the Weaviate host as mentioned in the basics above
$ docker run -i -e weaviate_host=$WEAVIATE_HOST semitechnologies/weaviate-demo-newspublications:latest
```

Usage with Docker on **local** host **with** Docker Compose;

_Note: run this from the same directory where the Weaviate Docker Compose files are located_

{% raw %}
```bash
# WEAVIATE HOST (e.g., http://localhost:8080), note the paragraph "basics" for setting the local IP
$ export WEAVIATE_HOST="http://$(docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' ${PWD##*/}_weaviate_1):8080"
# WEAVIATE NETWORK (see paragraph: Running on the localhost)
$ export WEAVIATE_NETWORK=$(docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.NetworkID}}{{end}}' ${PWD##*/}_weaviate_1)
# Run docker
$ docker run -i --network=$WEAVIATE_NETWORK -e weaviate_host=$WEAVIATE_HOST semitechnologies/weaviate-demo-newspublications:latest
```
{% endraw %}
