## Basics
- A python native weaviate client makes using the Weaviate API easier.

# Install

The package can be easily installed using pip. The client is developed and tested for python 3.7. 

```sh
pip install weaviate-client
```

# Usage

First make sure that weaviate is running. See the [installation guide](https://www.semi.technology/documentation/weaviate/current/get-started/install.html) on how to start weaviate.


Before we can load data we need to create a client and load a schema.

```python
import weaviate
client = weaviate.Client("http://localhost:8080")
client.create_schema("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/semi-technologies/weaviate-python-client/master/documentation/getting_started/people_schema.json")
```

A schema can be provided as an URL, file or a dict.
Now lets create some things.

```python
client.create_thing({"name": "John von Neumann"}, "Person", "b36268d4-a6b5-5274-985f-45f13ce0c642")
client.create_thing({"name": "Alan Turing"}, "Person", "1c9cd584-88fe-5010-83d0-017cb3fcb446")
client.create_thing({"name": "Legends"}, "Group", "2db436b5-0557-5016-9c5f-531412adf9c6")
```

We can simply add cross-references through:

```python
client.add_reference_to_thing("2db436b5-0557-5016-9c5f-531412adf9c6", "members", "b36268d4-a6b5-5274-985f-45f13ce0c642")
client.add_reference_to_thing("2db436b5-0557-5016-9c5f-531412adf9c6", "members", "1c9cd584-88fe-5010-83d0-017cb3fcb446")
```

*Note: Weaviate might needs a second to update its index after a new thing has been created.*

Look at the data using the simple query:
```graphql
{
  Get {
    Things {
      Group {
        name
        uuid
        Members {
          ... on Person {
            name
            uuid
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
